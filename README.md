# AdventureGame
Coursework for 'Game Programming with C++' and was created using Unreal Engine 4, version 4.21.1. The main focus of this work was to create a small game using C++, with as little blueprints as possible. This was the first time I had used the Unreal Engine, it is extremely powerful and I see why it is popular among the industry, although resources to work with exclusively C++ is limited as the blueprints available are ideal for artists and non-programmers.

The game features a 3D platformer type game with customized skeletons, animations, and various other incorporations that are available in the Unreal Engine. If you want to download and inspect the project yourself it is available here: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1MKj5pjxrr6YFiJ6ZvRH3pPBOfgD6RNJ9

Working as of [17/05/19] !Large File! 12GB +

This project features a lot of C++ techniques that are native to Engine such as TMaps and TArrays, these are demonstrated throughout the program, the HUD is also hardcoded instead of using the SLATE plugin..
